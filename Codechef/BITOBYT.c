Question
In the magical land of Byteland, there are three kinds of citizens:

a Bit - 2ms after a Bit appears, it grows up and becomes a Nibble (i.e. it disappears and a Nibble appears)
a Nibble - 8ms after a Nibble appears, it grows up and becomes a Byte
a Byte - 16ms after a Byte appears, it grows up, splits into two Bits and disappears
Chef wants to know the answer to the following question: what would the population of Byteland be immediately before the time Nms if only 1 Bit appeared at time 0ms?

Help him and find the population (number of citizens) of each type.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N.


Output
For each test case, print a single line containing three space-separated integers â€” the number of Bits, Nibbles and Bytes.
